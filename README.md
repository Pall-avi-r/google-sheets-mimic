# Google Sheets Mimic Web Application
Complete README.md for Assignment 1:
This web application mimics the functionality of Google Sheets, allowing users to interact with a spreadsheet interface. The app supports basic mathematical and data quality functions, data entry, and validation, as well as common spreadsheet operations such as adding/removing rows and columns.

## Features

### 1. Spreadsheet Interface:
- **UI Mimic**: The layout and design closely resemble Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and cell structure.
- **Drag Functionality**: Users can drag and drop cells, formulas, and selections to mirror Google Sheets behavior.
- **Cell Dependencies**: Formulas and functions automatically update when changes are made to dependent cells.
- **Basic Formatting**: Users can apply formatting like bold, italics, font size, and color to cells.
- **Row and Column Management**: Users can add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

### 2. Mathematical Functions:
The following functions are implemented:
- **SUM**: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of a range of cells.
- **MAX**: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.
- **MIN**: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of cells containing numerical values in a range.

### 3. Data Quality Functions:
The following data quality functions are supported:
- **TRIM**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a cell.
- **UPPER**: Converts the text in a cell to uppercase.
- **LOWER**: Converts the text in a cell to lowercase.
- **REMOVE_DUPLICATES**: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.
- **FIND_AND_REPLACE**: Allows users to find and replace specific text within a range of cells.

### 4. Data Entry and Validation:
- Users can input various types of data (numbers, text, dates).
- Basic data validation ensures that only valid data types are entered (e.g., ensuring numeric cells only contain numbers).

### 5. Testing:
- Users can test the implemented functions by entering data and observing the results.
- The results of function execution are displayed clearly.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For building the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the spreadsheet interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the interactive functionalities and handling data operations.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
